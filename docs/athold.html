<h1>Welcome to Limbo</h1>
<h2>Wha...?</h2>
<h3>Why You're Here</h3> <!--where I link all my websites that are still in development-->

<p> Hello and Welcome to the Waiting Area </p>
<p> You've probably in here because you have clicked one of the pages in my website which are still either in;</p>
<p> Development</p>
<p> Renovation</p>
<p> Being used as a placeholder</p>
<p> or I simply forgot to link it <span class="hilite"> (sorry!)</span></p>

<h3>Now What?</h3>
<p> To be honest, there is not much to do except to wait. Since playing games and compiling my experiences takes time, plus the pages are mostly walls of text for your eyes to feast upon. I really cannot entertain you except occupy your time by using this webpage as a cataclyst for my pleasure :)</p>

<h3>Why does it take time? You're just playing games</h3>
<p> Well, why wouldn't it take time? All actions would require a certain amount of time to accomplish as dictated by reality. It is not up to me to decide how long it would take to finish a page <span class="hilite">(of course it is up to me but anyways) </span>cause most of the work done here is simply a passion project of sorts. </p>
<p>If you haven't read the About section of this website then go read it first but basically, the primary reason this website was created was for my own selfish reasons as I'll be using this website to document my experiences with each game I have played. I am aware that chronicling my entire library of games <span class="hilite">(with more games being added) </span> would be time consuming and exhausting but this will serve as a time capsule.</p>
<p> With that said, Welcome to the Waiting Area once more!</p>
<p> With nothing in here but pointless ranting, you're free to stay!</p>
<p> or not... Anyway it's all up to you what to do at this point</p>
<p> Come Stay for a while if you're lonely :)</p>
