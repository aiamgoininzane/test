<h1>Omori Review</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Omori is a...<em>game</em>
</p> 
<p>This is a first in my life that a game has ever affected me so deeply. Omori is definitely an experience that I believe shouldn't be played by everyone, but why you ask? There are certain themes in the game that although share similar vibes and topics to others of its kind, it is simply a whole nother breed.
</p> 
<p>To start off the introductions, It is a game made in RPGMaker which is a classic choice as many fan-favorite jrpg games are also made within it such as; </p>
<p>Mad Father</p>
<p>Yume Nikki</p>
<p>Ib</p>
<p>Lisa</p>
<p>However, it is not without its faults as this ambitious project would be limited by the engine's ability to impemenet custom sprites and assets to it's systems which is the reason why the game sank in controversy due to it's incredibly long development time</p>
<p>Though in end, The Developers of the Game <span class="hilite">(Omocat)</span> were able to deliver a phenomenal product with multiple colorful and custom hand-drawn assets which made up the game's style as well as beautifully composed songs and osts to accompany a variety of player-driven cutscenes and an in-depth lore that is a rich in wonderfully written characters and relationships with one another.</p>
<p>These factors are not the main reason why the game is popular though, as with the joy-driven written description of the game lies a dark undertone which became infamous yet relatable for an esoteric number of fans.</p>
<p>With that said, I'll move on to my experience with the game...</p>

<h2>First Impressions</h2>
<h3>Initial Vibes</h3>
<p>Booted up the game and lo-and behold, an empty space...</p>
<p>Wow, what a great start! Anyways, the menu depicts a blank white space with the titular title diplayed at the top with an emotionless young kid staring deadset unto my eyes, sheesh, don't know what that was but it sorta reminds me of an empty canvas with how clean and <em>corruptuble</em> the whole thing looks...</p>
<p>Moving on, The Menu contains the the standard rpg options of "New Game", "Continue" <span class="hilite"> (which is greyed out)</span>and Options. </p>
<p>My Initial Reaction towards it is great! Not sure if I'm overthinking but I just loved the simplicity of it.</p>
<p>Besides that, There's not much to say except to jump straight into the world of Omori!</p>  

<h3>Character Impressions</h3>
<p>Okay so note to self, I LOVE OMORI ONGGGG AAAAAAA, I just discovered that the emotionless looking kid at the menu was named Omori! I was aware that it would be his name but thought too much haha</p>
<p>The other characters as well, I JUST LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE THEIR DESIGN, I'm loving their whole relationship dynamic in the sense that they're simply kids having fun! It reminds me of how I used have fun back, free from all the needless worries of being aware in life. Their untainted innocence as they debate over each other in what I deem to be an insigficant issue <span class="hilite">(they were arguing which one would be IT in a game of hide n seek) </span> though I am quite aware that this must mean the a lot for them so I simply chuckled it over haha</p>

<h3>Music Composition and Art Design</h3>
<p>To be honest, I am at a lost for words as this is one of the best game osts I have heard in some time <span class="hilite">(second to undertale ofc!) </span>. I like the whole floaaaattyyyy aesthitic of both the artstyle and the music. It fits the scenery and environment as the game starts off in outer space :0 . Sure, There are some hit and misses for the Music osts HOWEVER there are certified <b>bangers</b> within the game which only solidified its role in hiding within a part of my brain, casually chilling until I hear it again some time in the future xD</p> 
<p>Contrary to the art design, the game didn't miss not one bit! and I really love the game's aesthetic. PLUS, the game also switches art styles from time to time which if you think about it seems counter-intuitive as you're literally giving your game an identity crisis in some way. It really hits the mark as it only adds to the lore implications within it.</p>

<h3>Lore</h3>
<p>Speaking of lore implications, the game is jam packed with hot saucy lore that may or may not leave your brain scrambled and your emotions being played with as although surface-level lore does exist within the game, it is however not the entirety of the story.</p>
<p>Surprise surprise, the game features multiple endings! which is just woooooaaa, and although I was completely retarded with understanding the story, I felt that there's something more than meets the eye.</p>

<h3>Combat System</h3>
<p>With the game being developed in RPGMaker, I half-expected the game to of course include combat systems and let me tell you. I believe that this is the first time I have ever played a game with this uniqe type of combat mechanics.</p>
<p>How? Well, the game features a turn-based combat <span class="hilite"> (common with almost all rpgmaker games)</span> however, the game's main gimmick with its combat is that it has a rock-paper-scissors typing of both enemies and allies because emotions play a big factor in how a combat encounter ends;
<p>Sadness beats Anger, </p>
<p>Anger beats Happiness, </p>
<p>and Happiness beats Sadness.</p>
<p> there's also a 4th emotion which is simply Neutral, which has no downsides nor upsides in combat whatsoever. You could visualise the combat typing as one
triangle with neutral being in the center. </p>
<p>Additionally, emotions have two levels which are basically the base emotions and their respective upgrades</p>
<p>Other than that, the combat isn't all that complex and the emotion typing is what I believed to be their interpretation of skill impression for veteran players. </p>

<h3>Initial Conclusion</h3>
<p> I haven't completed the game yet but I felt compelled to write a preliminary review to vent off some of my stress and fustrations of daily life. I have completed around 60% of it and I'll probably finish it somewhere in the near future.</p>

<p>But for now, I'll rate this Experience as <b>Foreseeable Depression out of 10</b></p>

<h3>Endnote</h3>
<p>Though I haven't finshed the game nor my insight, I wholeheartedly believe that you should buy it once it goes on sale.</p>
<p>Go buy or wishlist the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/" target="_blank">Steam</a> if you haven't already.</p>
