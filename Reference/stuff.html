<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<p>Yo Hellooo, you can call me Zane or Blu. I am the sole developer of the website memoirS which I developed for my school project as a requirement for this semester</p>
<h3>What is the Website about?</h3>
<p>Well, I created the website for my own usage as I am intending it to be my own personal diary specifically detailing my experiences in playing games and also as a way of improving my programming skills. It would also serve as a sort of time capsule for me as I do not have the greatest of memory. I would imagine myself looking at my past experiences as a form of nostalgia. </p>

<h3>How long did it take you to develop the website?</h3>
<p>The website will never be finished as this is a progressive website meaning it gradually evolves over time. But if you're asking me how long did it took me to create this whole behemoth, then it took me around;
<p>1 Week of Thinking of a Concept for this Baby,</p>
<p>Around 2 months of Procrastinating,</p>
<p>2-3ish Months of Laying down the Framework of HTML and CSS,</p>
<p>2 Weeks of Thinking of a Javascript implementation,</p>
<p>and an Indefinite amount of time Playing and Chronicling Games :3</p>

<h3>Why are there no pictures?</h3>
<p>Simply put, I do not need them. As I've said, this website is for myself hence I am not catering to their interests and needs. I do not need pictures to accompany my experiences as I have all of them inside my head.

<h3>Why did I create an About section?</h3>
<p>Even if the website is for myself, there would still be people gaining access to it plus this is a school project so might as well include an about section to prevent misunderstanding of my creation. </p> 

<h3>How do I navigate the website then?</h3>
<p>Simply click on the Logo on top of the website to go back to the Homepage.</p>
<p>You can also use the checkboxes to quickly navigate through my pages.</p>
<p>There's also a pretty nifty button located at the bottom of a page for my <span class="hilite"> (or your) </span> convenience</p>
